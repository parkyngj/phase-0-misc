airplane = {

        pretty_name: 'First Class',
        seat_info: {
            total_seats: 6,
            seats_available: 4
        },

# 1.
# Guess the return value of this line:

# airplane[:first_class][:pretty_name]

## I guess that it will return "First Class"

# Then uncomment the line above and check your guess.

## It was right!

# 2.
# Guess the return value of this line:

# airplane[:business_class][:meals]

## I guess that it will return the array ["Sustainably Cultivated Lobster with Housemade Butter", "Kale Salad"]

# Then uncomment the line above and check your guess.

## It was right!

# 3.
# Guess the return value of this line:

# airplane[:business_class][:meals][1]

## I guess that it will return "Kale Salad"

# Then uncomment the line above and check your guess.

## It was right!

# 4.
# How will this line affect the data structure?

# airplane[:coach][:meals].push("Sad Plastic Tray of Corn")

## It will update the value of the "meals" key by appending the string "Sad Plastic Tray of Corn" as a new array item at the end of the array

# Uncomment the lines above and check your guess by adding a line that prints the new data structure.

## It was right!

# 5.
# How would you reverse the meals list in First Class?

## I would type airplane[:first_class][:meals].reverse (If I wanted to update the hash itself, I would type airplane[:first_class][:meals].reverse!)

# Add a line of code that does that here.

## It worked!

# 6.
# How would you lowercase the pretty name of one of the classes?

## For example, if I wanted to lowercase the pretty name of First Class, I would type airplane[:first_class][:pretty_name].downcase (If I wanted to update the hash itself, I would type airplane[:first_class][:pretty_name].downcase!)

# Add a line of code that does that here.

## It worked!
