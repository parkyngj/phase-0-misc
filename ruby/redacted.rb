# A Ruby program that will ask a user for a string (a sentence), ask the user if any words in the sentence should be redacted, and then return the original string with the redacted words removed.

# Ask the user what their sentence is
puts "What is the sentence you'd like to censor from?"
sent = gets.chomp

# Ask the user for their desired redacted word

## Execute conversion of sentence:
# Convert the sentence into an array

# Initialize empty array for new sentence

# Check each element in the array if it's equal to redacted word

  # If it is, then append "REDACTED" to the new array

  # If it isn't, then append the word as it is to the new array

# Now collapse the elements new array into one string/sentence


## Conversion complete, return the new string
